# Java Programming 1 MOOC University of Helsinki
 
This is the first part of the [University of Helsinkiâ€™s free massive open online course (MOOC) on Object-Oriented Programming with Java](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/).
The course is split up into two individual courses: *Java Programming I* and *Java Programming II*. Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set.
This java mooc course part 1 was really crucial in my understandig of core JAVA and helped me to understand java concepts better.
