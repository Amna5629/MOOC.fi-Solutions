# Java Programming 2 MOOC University of Helsinki
 
This is the second part of the [University of Helsinki’s free massive open online course (MOOC) on Object-Oriented Programming with Java](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/).
The course is split up into two individual courses: *Java Programming I* and *Java Programming II*. Each course consists of seven parts, each with its own exercise set.
This Java MOOC course Part 2 was really crucial in deepening my understanding of core Java concepts. It helped me grasp important programming principles better, such as object-oriented design, data structures, and exception handling.

Inside this folder, you’ll find solutions organized by the different parts of the course. Each folder contains exercises and projects designed to reinforce the concepts taught in the course.

## Topics Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Inheritance)
- Interfaces and Abstract Classes
- Exception Handling
- Collections (Lists, Maps, Sets)
- File I/O
- Recursion
- Testing with JUnit
